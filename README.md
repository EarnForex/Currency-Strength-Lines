# Currency Strength Lines

Currency Strength Lines is a custom MetaTrader indicator that calculates relative strength for up to eight major currencies for MT4 and MT5, coded by EarnForex.com. The indicator is displayed in the separate chart window and is highly customizable.

It supports display of upper timeframe calculations (basic MTF capability) and all three alert types: native, mobile, and email.
